// How we should do it?

// I would say we should do the exercise in two ways. 
// 1. First we should write tests by having everything in the spec file such as the logic required to interact the angular template or use 
//    of protractor specific vocabularies(by.binding, by.model... etc) to locate elements. 
// 2. Then we should create the page object for this test file and move the required logic to interact with the Angular template, into it. 
//    In this case our spec file will only have the assertion (expect) statements in the end.

// In my opinion the minimum scenarios we could cover for exercise 1, are as:

// 1. Count the number of users by using the locator element.all(...) 
// 2. Count the number of users by using a by.repeater(...)
// 3. Find Chuck Norris email address in the first row
// 4. Find the email address for John Rambo
// 5. Get the Email columns information
